#  JUnit + Spring Boot Testing Project

This project demonstrates how to implement testing in **Spring Boot applications** using **JUnit** and **Spring Test frameworks**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

### ðŸ§ª Unit Testing
- Service layer unit tests with **mocking**
- Controller layer unit tests with **MockMvc**

### ðŸ”— Integration Testing
- Full end-to-end tests with **H2 in-memory database**
- Data persistence testing by posting and retrieving records
- **Top-down approach** ensuring all layers work together

---

## ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of:

- Writing unit tests for **isolated components**
- Building integration tests that **simulate real scenarios**
- Using **H2 database** to test persistence without external setup
- Following **test-driven development (TDD)** practices for clean, reliable code
